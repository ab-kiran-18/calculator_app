# calculator_app
It is a small demonstration of how we can use python libraries like Tkinter to create simple apps such as  a calculator...
It is a simple app which is only works on the concepts of oops
  the thing i want to say about this repo is i have learnt a lot about object oreinted things and this is the first time i have used a oops concept on realtime.
  this simple app made me to know better how objects and classes work actually.
